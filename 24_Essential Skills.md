## Essential Penetration Testing Skills

- **What essential pentesting skills are**
  - Core competencies needed for effective security testing
  - Techniques to bypass defenses and identify vulnerabilities
  - Methods to adapt known exploits to new environments
  - Skills to discover unknown or hidden vulnerabilities
  - Approaches to overcome security controls and filters
  - Abilities to optimize testing workflow and efficiency
  - Techniques to simulate real-world attackers' methodologies
  - Skills to maximize test coverage within time constraints
  - Methods to prioritize findings based on exploitability and impact
  - Capabilities to identify subtle security flaws in complex systems
  - Techniques to chain multiple vulnerabilities for maximum impact
  - Ability to understand and manipulate underlying technologies
  - Skills to effectively document and communicate findings

- **Why these skills matter**
  - Real applications have unique implementations of security controls
  - Many websites employ multiple layers of defenses
  - Time constraints require efficient testing methodologies
  - Vulnerabilities often require creative exploitation approaches
  - Security controls may be incomplete or incorrectly implemented
  - Standard payloads are often blocked by WAFs and filters
  - Practical exploitation requires adapting techniques to specific contexts
  - Multiple technologies often interact in ways that create security gaps
  - Understanding defense bypass techniques reveals security control weaknesses
  - Finding what others have missed demonstrates valuable security expertise
  - Realistic attacks often chain multiple vulnerabilities together
  - Automation complements but cannot replace human intuition

- **Payload obfuscation and encoding techniques**

  - **Understanding encoding basics**
    - URL encoding (percent encoding)
    - HTML encoding (character entity references)
    - Base64 encoding
    - Unicode and UTF-8 encoding
    - Hex encoding
    - ASCII encoding
    - Double encoding
    - Custom encoding schemes

  - **Character set manipulation**
    1. **Unicode normalization exploitation**:
       - Step 1: Identify characters that have equivalent Unicode normalizations
       - Step 2: Replace standard characters with alternate Unicode representations
       - Step 3: Test if the application normalizes differently at different layers
       - Step 4: Craft payloads using these differences to bypass filters
       - Step 5: Execute the attack using the normalization discrepancy
       - Example: Using LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX (â) instead of 'a'
       - Exploitation insight: Different application layers may normalize Unicode differently
       - Python script for Unicode normalization bypasses:
       ```python
       import unicodedata
       
       # Original payload
       original = "SELECT * FROM users"
       
       # Create obfuscated version using Unicode character substitution
       obfuscated = original.replace("S", "Ѕ")  # Cyrillic letter Es instead of Latin S
       obfuscated = obfuscated.replace("E", "Е")  # Cyrillic letter Ie instead of Latin E
       obfuscated = obfuscated.replace("L", "Ⱡ")  # Latin letter L with double bar
       
       print("Original:", original)
       print("Obfuscated:", obfuscated)
       
       # Check normalization forms
       print("NFC form:", unicodedata.normalize('NFC', obfuscated))
       print("NFD form:", unicodedata.normalize('NFD', obfuscated))
       print("NFKC form:", unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', obfuscated))
       print("NFKD form:", unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', obfuscated))
       ```

    2. **Homoglyph substitution**:
       - Step 1: Identify visually similar characters in different Unicode blocks
       - Step 2: Replace standard ASCII characters with their homoglyphs
       - Step 3: Test if security filters check only for ASCII variants
       - Step 4: Create payloads using these homoglyphs to bypass pattern matching
       - Step 5: Submit the obfuscated payload
       - Example: Replace 'o' with 'о' (Cyrillic 'o', U+043E)
       - Common substitutions: 
         - a → а (Cyrillic а, U+0430)
         - e → е (Cyrillic е, U+0435)
         - p → р (Cyrillic р, U+0440)
         - s → ѕ (Cyrillic ѕ, U+0455)
       - Python script for homoglyph substitution:
       ```python
       # Homoglyph mapping
       homoglyphs = {
           'a': 'а',  # Cyrillic
           'c': 'с',  # Cyrillic
           'e': 'е',  # Cyrillic
           'o': 'о',  # Cyrillic
           'p': 'р',  # Cyrillic
           's': 'ѕ',  # Cyrillic
           'x': 'х',  # Cyrillic
           'y': 'у',  # Cyrillic
           'A': 'А',  # Cyrillic
           'B': 'В',  # Cyrillic
           'E': 'Е',  # Cyrillic
           'K': 'К',  # Cyrillic
           'M': 'М',  # Cyrillic
           'H': 'Н',  # Cyrillic
           'O': 'О',  # Cyrillic
           'P': 'Р',  # Cyrillic
           'C': 'С',  # Cyrillic
           'T': 'Т',  # Cyrillic
           'X': 'Х',  # Cyrillic
       }
       
       def obfuscate_with_homoglyphs(text):
           result = ""
           for char in text:
               if char in homoglyphs:
                   result += homoglyphs[char]
               else:
                   result += char
           return result
       
       # Example payload obfuscation
       payload = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'--"
       obfuscated = obfuscate_with_homoglyphs(payload)
       
       print("Original:", payload)
       print("Obfuscated:", obfuscated)
       ```

  - **HTML encoding techniques**
    1. **HTML entity obfuscation**:
       - Step 1: Identify characters in your payload that can be HTML-encoded
       - Step 2: Replace them with their HTML entity equivalents (named or numeric)
       - Step 3: Test different encoding variations to find filter bypasses
       - Step 4: Create a payload mixing encoded and plain characters
       - Step 5: Submit the obfuscated payload and check for execution
       - Example: Convert `<script>` to `&lt;script&gt;` or `&#60;script&#62;`
       - Decimal vs. hexadecimal encoding: `&#97;` vs. `&#x61;` for 'a'
       - Testing insight: Some filters check for decoded values while others match exact patterns
       - Python script for HTML entity encoding:
       ```python
       def html_encode_payload(payload, encoding_type="decimal"):
           result = ""
           for char in payload:
               if encoding_type == "decimal":
                   result += "&#" + str(ord(char)) + ";"
               elif encoding_type == "hex":
                   result += "&#x" + hex(ord(char))[2:] + ";"
               elif encoding_type == "named" and char in html_entities:
                   result += "&" + html_entities[char] + ";"
               else:
                   result += char
           return result
       
       # HTML entity map (partial)
       html_entities = {
           '<': 'lt',
           '>': 'gt',
           '"': 'quot',
           "'": 'apos',
           '&': 'amp',
           ' ': 'nbsp'
       }
       
       # Example
       xss_payload = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
       
       decimal_encoded = html_encode_payload(xss_payload, "decimal")
       hex_encoded = html_encode_payload(xss_payload, "hex")
       
       # Mixed encoding (harder to detect)
       mixed_encoded = ""
       for i, char in enumerate(xss_payload):
           if i % 3 == 0:
               mixed_encoded += "&#" + str(ord(char)) + ";"
           elif i % 3 == 1:
               mixed_encoded += "&#x" + hex(ord(char))[2:] + ";"
           else:
               mixed_encoded += char
       
       print("Original:", xss_payload)
       print("Decimal:", decimal_encoded)
       print("Hex:", hex_encoded)
       print("Mixed:", mixed_encoded)
       ```

    2. **Mixed encoding techniques**:
       - Step 1: Divide your payload into segments
       - Step 2: Apply different encoding schemes to each segment
       - Step 3: Combine the segments to create a payload with mixed encoding
       - Step 4: Test if the application decodes all formats correctly
       - Step 5: Adjust the encoding mix until you bypass filters
       - Example: `<script>` as `<scr&#105;pt>` or `<scr%69pt>`
       - Advanced technique: Randomize encoding for each character
       - Testing insight: Mixed encoding often reveals inconsistencies in decoding routines
       - JavaScript function for mixed encoding:
       ```javascript
       function mixedEncode(payload) {
           const encodingTypes = ["none", "html", "htmlHex", "url", "urlDouble"];
           let result = "";
           
           for (let i = 0; i < payload.length; i++) {
               // Choose encoding type pseudo-randomly but deterministically
               const encodingType = encodingTypes[i % encodingTypes.length];
               const char = payload[i];
               
               switch (encodingType) {
                   case "none":
                       result += char;
                       break;
                   case "html":
                       result += "&#" + char.charCodeAt(0) + ";";
                       break;
                   case "htmlHex":
                       result += "&#x" + char.charCodeAt(0).toString(16) + ";";
                       break;
                   case "url":
                       result += "%" + char.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).padStart(2, '0');
                       break;
                   case "urlDouble":
                       // Double URL encoding
                       const hexCode = char.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).padStart(2, '0');
                       result += "%25" + hexCode;
                       break;
               }
           }
           
           return result;
       }
       
       // Example
       const payload = "<script>alert(1)</script>";
       console.log("Mixed encoding: " + mixedEncode(payload));
       ```

  - **URL encoding bypasses**
    1. **Standard URL encoding**:
       - Step 1: Identify special characters in your payload
       - Step 2: Replace them with their percent-encoded equivalents
       - Step 3: Test if application properly decodes URL-encoded values
       - Step 4: Create a payload using URL encoding to bypass pattern matching
       - Step 5: Submit and observe execution
       - Example: Convert space to `%20`, slash to `%2F`
       - Common encoded characters: 
         - Space: `%20`
         - Double quote: `%22`
         - Single quote: `%27`
         - Less than: `%3C`
         - Greater than: `%3E`
       - Testing insight: Some applications decode URL encoding before security checks

    2. **Double URL encoding**:
       - Step 1: Identify characters that would normally be URL-encoded
       - Step 2: Apply URL encoding to the % character itself (becomes %25)
       - Step 3: Create doubly-encoded values (e.g., < becomes %253C instead of %3C)
       - Step 4: Test if the application performs multiple decode operations
       - Step 5: Construct a payload that will be correctly decoded after multiple passes
       - Example: `<` encoded as `%3C`, then double-encoded as `%253C`
       - Testing insight: Multiple decoding operations may occur at different application layers
       - Python script for double URL encoding:
       ```python
       import urllib.parse
       
       def double_url_encode(payload):
           # First URL encoding
           single_encoded = urllib.parse.quote(payload)
           # Second URL encoding (encode the % signs)
           double_encoded = single_encoded.replace('%', '%25')
           return double_encoded
       
       # Alternative implementation that properly double-encodes
       def proper_double_url_encode(payload):
           # First URL encoding
           single_encoded = urllib.parse.quote(payload)
           # Second URL encoding
           double_encoded = urllib.parse.quote(single_encoded)
           return double_encoded
       
       # Example payload
       path_traversal = "../../etc/passwd"
       sql_injection = "' OR 1=1--"
       
       print("Original path traversal:", path_traversal)
       print("Double-encoded path traversal:", double_url_encode(path_traversal))
       print("Proper double-encoded path traversal:", proper_double_url_encode(path_traversal))
       
       print("Original SQL injection:", sql_injection)
       print("Double-encoded SQL injection:", double_url_encode(sql_injection))
       print("Proper double-encoded SQL injection:", proper_double_url_encode(sql_injection))
       ```

    3. **Case variation in URL encoding**:
       - Step 1: Identify hexadecimal characters in URL-encoded values
       - Step 2: Create variations using uppercase and lowercase hex digits
       - Step 3: Test if application treats them as equivalent or different
       - Step 4: Use the case variation that bypasses filters
       - Step 5: Submit and test execution
       - Example: `%3c` vs `%3C` for the < character
       - Testing insight: Some filters check for specific case patterns in hex encoding
       - Python script for case variation in URL encoding:
       ```python
       import random
       
       def random_case_url_encode(payload):
           result = ""
           for char in payload:
               # URL encode the character
               hex_code = format(ord(char), '02x')
               # Randomize the case
               hex_code_random_case = ''.join(random.choice([c.upper(), c.lower()]) for c in hex_code)
               result += "%" + hex_code_random_case
           return result
       
       # Example
       xss_payload = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
       
       # Generate 5 different case variations
       for i in range(5):
           encoded = random_case_url_encode(xss_payload)
           print(f"Variation {i+1}: {encoded}")
       ```

  - **XML-based encoding techniques**
    1. **XML entity encoding**:
       - Step 1: Define custom XML entities in the DOCTYPE
       - Step 2: Use these entities in your payload to obfuscate it
       - Step 3: Test if the XML parser resolves entities before security checks
       - Step 4: Chain multiple entities for deeper obfuscation
       - Step 5: Submit the XML with encoded payload
       - Example: Define `<!ENTITY xxe "SELECT">` and use `&xxe;` in queries
       - Testing insight: XML parsers resolve entities before data reaches application logic
       - Example XML with entity obfuscation:
       ```xml
       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY s "S">
           <!ENTITY e "E">
           <!ENTITY l "L">
           <!ENTITY sel "&s;&e;&l;">
           <!ENTITY ect "ECT">
           <!ENTITY select "&sel;&ect;">
           <!ENTITY from "FROM">
           <!ENTITY users "users">
       ]>
       <root>
         <query>&select; * &from; &users;</query>
       </root>
       ```

    2. **XML CDATA obfuscation**:
       - Step 1: Identify characters that would normally be escaped in XML
       - Step 2: Wrap payload in CDATA sections to prevent XML parsing
       - Step 3: Test if application extracts and processes CDATA contents
       - Step 4: Combine with entity encoding for deeper obfuscation
       - Step 5: Submit and observe execution
       - Example: `<![CDATA[<script>alert(1)</script>]]>`
       - Testing insight: CDATA prevents XML parsing but content may still be processed
       - Example XML with CDATA obfuscation:
       ```xml
       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <root>
         <query><![CDATA[SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' OR 1=1--]]></query>
       </root>
       ```

    3. **Character reference obfuscation in XML**:
       - Step 1: Identify special characters in your payload
       - Step 2: Replace them with numeric or hexadecimal character references
       - Step 3: Test if XML parser resolves these references
       - Step 4: Create a payload mixing different reference types
       - Step 5: Submit the XML with obfuscated payload
       - Example: `&#83;&#69;&#76;&#69;&#67;&#84;` for "SELECT"
       - Decimal vs. hexadecimal: `&#83;` vs. `&#x53;` for 'S'
       - Example XML with character reference obfuscation:
       ```xml
       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <root>
         <query>&#x53;&#x45;&#x4C;&#x45;&#x43;&#x54; * &#70;&#82;&#79;&#77; users</query>
       </root>
       ```

  - **Multi-layered encoding techniques**
    1. **Chained encoding attacks**:
       - Step 1: Apply first layer of encoding to your payload
       - Step 2: Apply second layer of encoding to the result
       - Step 3: Continue adding layers as needed
       - Step 4: Test if application sequentially decodes all layers
       - Step 5: Submit the multi-encoded payload
       - Example: Base64 encode a payload, then URL-encode the Base64 string
       - Testing insight: Applications often decode outer layers before inner ones
       - Python script for multi-layered encoding:
       ```python
       import base64
       import urllib.parse
       
       def multi_layer_encode(payload, layers):
           """
           Apply multiple layers of encoding to a payload
           layers: list of encoding types in order ('base64', 'url', 'hex', 'html')
           """
           result = payload
           for layer in layers:
               if layer == 'base64':
                   result = base64.b64encode(result.encode()).decode()
               elif layer == 'url':
                   result = urllib.parse.quote(result)
               elif layer == 'hex':
                   result = ''.join([hex(ord(c))[2:].zfill(2) for c in result])
               elif layer == 'html':
                   result = ''.join(['&#' + str(ord(c)) + ';' for c in result])
           return result
       
       # Example
       payload = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'--"
       
       # Try different layer combinations
       encoding_combinations = [
           ['base64'],
           ['url'],
           ['base64', 'url'],
           ['url', 'base64'],
           ['base64', 'url', 'base64'],
           ['hex', 'url'],
           ['html', 'url']
       ]
       
       for layers in encoding_combinations:
           encoded = multi_layer_encode(payload, layers)
           print(f"Encoding layers: {' -> '.join(layers)}")
           print(f"Result: {encoded}")
           print("-" * 50)
       ```

    2. **Encoding with different charsets**:
       - Step 1: Identify character encoding supported by the application
       - Step 2: Encode your payload using non-standard character sets
       - Step 3: Test if application correctly decodes the charset
       - Step 4: Submit the encoded payload with appropriate charset declaration
       - Step 5: Observe if decoding discrepancies allow filter bypass
       - Example: Use UTF-7 encoding instead of UTF-8
       - Testing insight: Different application layers may use different charset decoders
       - Python script for charset encoding:
       ```python
       def encode_with_charset(payload, charset):
           """
           Encode a payload using different character sets
           """
           try:
               # Encode to bytes in the specified charset
               encoded_bytes = payload.encode(charset)
               # For display purposes, convert to hex representation
               hex_representation = encoded_bytes.hex()
               # Return both the raw encoded bytes and hex representation

           return result, encodings_used, chunks
       
       # Example
       payload = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'--"
       encoded_result, encodings, original_chunks = hybrid_encode(payload)
       
       print("Original payload:", payload)
